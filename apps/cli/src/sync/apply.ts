/**
 * Tier 5e — apply rules.
 *
 * Walks `pulled_at IS NOT NULL AND applied_at IS NULL` rows from `sync_journal`
 * and translates each into a local store mutation. Each per-op handler writes
 * direct SQL that does NOT call into the journaling mutators (Option B from
 * TIER-5E-APPLY-RULES.md) — otherwise applying a pulled entry would generate
 * a fresh journal row that would then push back to the relay and bounce
 * across the device cluster forever.
 *
 * Per-entry transactional boundary: each entry's apply + `markApplied` runs
 * inside a single `db.transaction()`. If apply throws, the markApplied rolls
 * back too, so the next `applyPending` call retries the entry. If apply
 * succeeds and markApplied succeeds, both commit together — no partial state.
 *
 * Idempotency by op:
 *   - concept_create — INSERT OR IGNORE on slug PK
 *   - trajectory     — INSERT OR IGNORE on source PK (content-hashed source_id)
 *   - feedback       — INSERT OR IGNORE on the partial UNIQUE INDEX over sync_id
 *   - truth_update   — existence check on `concept_truth_history.superseded_by`
 *                      (when winning) or on (slug, updated_at, device_id, truth)
 *                      (when losing)
 *   - retire         — COALESCE so re-apply doesn't overwrite the original timestamp
 *
 * Ordering: `listUnapplied` returns rows ordered by `sync_id ASC`. Because
 * sync_ids are UUIDv7-shaped (timestamp-prefixed), this approximates causal
 * order: a `concept_create` for slug X arrives before a `feedback` for X
 * from the same device. Cross-device clock skew can violate this; out-of-
 * order entries fail per-entry (FK or "concept not found") and stay
 * `applied_at = NULL` until the prerequisite arrives on a later cycle.
