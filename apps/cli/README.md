# lumen-kb

Local-first knowledge compiler. Ingest articles, papers, PDFs, YouTube transcripts, code repositories, datasets (CSV / JSONL / HuggingFace), images with OCR, and Obsidian vault clippings into a searchable knowledge graph — then wire it into Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP client. Now with **opt-in end-to-end-encrypted cross-device sync** so your knowledge base follows you across laptops.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g lumen-kb
```

## Quick start

```bash
# Set up
lumen init
echo 'ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...' > ~/.lumen/.env

# Ingest
lumen add https://karpathy.medium.com/software-2-0-a64152b37c35
lumen add ./papers/attention.pdf
lumen add https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY
lumen add 1706.03762                                      # arXiv by ID
lumen add https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code       # whole code repo
lumen add ./data/results.csv                              # dataset

```

## Wire into Claude Code

```bash
lumen install claude
```

One command. Generates `CLAUDE.md` (brain-first protocol), `.mcp.json`, hooks, and a skill file. Claude checks your knowledge base before answering and captures new ideas after every response.

## MCP server

```bash
lumen --mcp    # 23 tools via stdio
```

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "lumen": { "command": "lumen", "args": ["--mcp"] } } }
```

Tools: `brain_ops`, `search`, `query`, `concept`, `add_link`, `links`, `backlinks`, `god_nodes`, `pagerank`, `path`, `neighbors`, `communities`, `community`, `add`, `compile`, `capture`, `session_summary`, `brain_feedback`, `retire_skill`, `capture_trajectory`, `replay_skill`, `status`, `profile`.

## Cross-device sync (v0.2.0)

Opt-in, end-to-end-encrypted sync across your laptops. Every concept-touching mutation lands in an append-only journal, gets sealed with X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305 on-device, and pushes to a self-hostable Cloudflare Worker relay. The relay holds opaque ciphertext only — it never sees your master key or your concepts.

```bash
# On device A (the seeder):
lumen sync init --relay https://lumen-relay.<your-account>.workers.dev
lumen sync enable
lumen sync show-key --reveal           # copy this key into a password manager

# On device B (and C, D, …):
lumen sync import-key "<base64 key>" --relay <same URL>
lumen sync enable
lumen sync run                          # push, pull, apply in one cycle
```

The reference relay is a ~600-LOC Cloudflare Worker shipped under `apps/relay/` in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Sardor-M/Lumen) — deployable in three `wrangler` commands.

What syncs: concept creations, compiled-truth updates, `+1`/`-1` feedback, retirements, and replayable trajectories. What doesn't: source files (`lumen add` content), embeddings, raw chunks — those stay local-first.

## Cross-device sync — automatic mode

`lumen sync run` is on-demand by default. Two layers stack to make sync feel transparent across your laptops without manual commands.

### Layer 1 — auto-push after every Claude Code response

`lumen install claude` writes a Stop hook (`.claude/hooks/lumen-signal.sh`) that fires at the end of every Claude response. As of v0.2.0+, that hook runs `timeout 8 lumen sync run` first, so any concepts Claude just created (`add` + `compile`, `capture`, `brain_feedback`, `retire_skill`, `capture_trajectory`) push to the relay before the next turn.

The push is time-bounded to 8 seconds and silently no-ops when sync is disabled, no relay is configured, or the relay is unreachable — so the agent loop is never stalled by network conditions.

This covers the "push side" inside Claude sessions. It doesn't pull, and it doesn't fire when you're working from a plain terminal.

### Layer 2 — periodic background sync via launchd / systemd

For full both-direction sync regardless of whether an agent is running, drop a small unit file into your OS scheduler. Templates ship under `apps/cli/templates/` (or `<install-prefix>/lib/node_modules/lumen-kb/templates/` if you installed via `npm install -g`):

**macOS (LaunchAgent):**

```bash
# Copy + edit + load
cp <templates>/launchd/com.lumen.sync.plist.template ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lumen.sync.plist

# Edit the file: replace <PATH> and <HOME> with your real values, e.g.
#   PATH = /usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/Users/me/.npm-global/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
#   HOME = /Users/me
# (uncomment the LUMEN_KEYRING_BACKEND line + set to "file" if you bypass Keychain)

launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lumen.sync.plist

# Verify it's firing
launchctl list | grep lumen
tail -f /tmp/lumen-sync.log
```

**Linux (systemd user services):**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp <templates>/systemd/lumen-sync.service.template ~/.config/systemd/user/lumen-sync.service
cp <templates>/systemd/lumen-sync.timer.template   ~/.config/systemd/user/lumen-sync.timer

# Edit lumen-sync.service: replace <LUMEN_BIN> (e.g., /usr/local/bin/lumen) and <HOME>

systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now lumen-sync.timer

# Verify
systemctl --user list-timers | grep lumen-sync
journalctl --user -u lumen-sync.service -f
```

**Tunable interval** — both templates default to 120 seconds. Override:

- launchd: edit `<integer>120</integer>` under `StartInterval`
- systemd: edit `OnUnitActiveSec=120` in `lumen-sync.timer`

Recommended: **60s** for active testing, **120s** general use, **300–900s** for low-power.

**Pause / resume:**

```bash
# macOS
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lumen.sync.plist
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.lumen.sync.plist

# Linux
systemctl --user stop  lumen-sync.timer
systemctl --user start lumen-sync.timer
```

### Layer 3 — managed sync daemon (v0.3.0)

As of v0.3.0 you no longer need to hand-edit the templates above. A
first-class managed daemon detects your platform, generates and loads the
unit file, and handles its own lifecycle:

```bash
lumen sync daemon install      # generate + load the launchd plist / systemd unit
lumen sync daemon status       # installed? managed vs. manual shape? PID alive?
lumen sync daemon uninstall    # bootout/disable + remove the unit and PID file
```

The daemon adapts its cadence automatically — Active (~30s) when there's
pending push work or recent pulls returned rows, Idle (~300s) after a few
empty pulls — and debounces bursts of journal writes (e.g. during a long
`lumen compile`) into a single push. If you previously copied the manual
PR #27 templates, `lumen sync daemon install --replace-manual` detects that
shape (`StartInterval` / `Type=oneshot`), unloads it, and installs the
managed daemon in its place. The Layer 2 manual templates remain supported.

#### Inspecting the daemon log

When sync isn't behaving, `lumen sync daemon logs` tails the daemon's output
without you needing to remember the platform-specific path (launchd's
`StandardOutPath` on macOS, systemd's `append:` file on Linux — both resolve
to the same `~/.lumen/sync-daemon.log`):

```bash
lumen sync daemon logs              # last 50 lines
lumen sync daemon logs --follow     # stream new lines (Ctrl-C to exit)
lumen sync daemon logs --since 1h   # only entries from the last hour (30s, 5m, 1h, 1d)
lumen sync daemon logs --lines 200  # custom backlog size (capped at 10000)
lumen sync daemon logs --json       # structured output for scripts
```

Same shape as `docker logs` / `kubectl logs`. `--since` filters on each
entry's JSON `ts`; `--follow` survives log rotation and exits cleanly on
Ctrl-C.

### Layer 4 — real-time propagation inside agent sessions

The daemon's cadence (Active ~30s) is fine for idle devices, but too slow
when a coding agent writes on laptop A and you immediately continue on
laptop B. So the MCP server propagates writes in real-time without the
daemon: after every journaling tool call (`add`, `compile`, `capture`,
`capture_trajectory`, `brain_feedback`, `retire_skill`) it fires a
fire-and-forget background push and returns the tool response immediately.
The next pull on a peer device picks the write up sub-second — no manual
`lumen sync push`, no waiting on the daemon timer. The push is skipped
entirely when sync is disabled, never blocks the tool response, swallows
relay failures (the write stays journaled locally for the daemon to retry),
and coalesces bursts so a long `compile` triggers at most one trailing push.

## How it works

1. **Ingest** — extract content from any source (articles, papers, video transcripts, code repos, datasets, images, Obsidian clippings), chunk structurally, deduplicate via SHA-256, index with FTS5
2. **Compile** — LLM extracts concepts + weighted edges, builds compiled truth + timeline per concept. The compiler surfaces the brain's most-mentioned concepts as a "reuse these slugs" hint and resolves every edge endpoint against the whole graph (exact → alias-aware → fuzzy), so new sources connect into the existing graph instead of forming isolated islands
3. **Search** — BM25 + TF-IDF + vector ANN fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion, budget-cut by relevance density
4. **Enrich** — concepts auto-escalate from stub (Tier 3) to full knowledge page (Tier 1) as evidence grows
5. **Agent loop** — `brain_ops` checks the KB before answering, `capture` persists new ideas after responding
6. **Sync** — opt-in journal of concept-touching mutations, sealed with X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305, pushed to a zero-knowledge Cloudflare Worker relay
