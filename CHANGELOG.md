All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added — Connect the graph across sources (#52)

The compiler now keeps the knowledge graph connected as new sources land,
instead of letting each `compile` pass coin slugs in isolation and form
cross-source edges only by coincidence.

- **Known-concepts hint.** Before compiling a source, the most-mentioned
  active concepts (up to `KNOWN_CONCEPT_HINT_LIMIT` = 80, ordered by
  mention count, retired concepts excluded) are inlined into the LLM prompt
  as a "reuse these slugs verbatim when a chunk references the same idea"
  block. This is the single highest-impact change for connectivity — without
  it, every pass invents fresh slugs and the graph fragments into per-source
  islands. Prompt overhead stays under ~2k tokens.
- **Global edge resolver.** Every edge endpoint is now resolved against the
  whole brain, not just the concepts emitted in the current pass:
  (1) exact match against in-pass concepts, (2) alias-aware exact match
  against any concept in the DB (canonicalized via `getConcept`, retired
  concepts rejected), then (3) fuzzy slug match using the same Levenshtein
  threshold as dedup (`SLUG_SIM_THRESHOLD`), with a length pre-filter to skip
  candidates that can't beat the current best. Previously, edges referencing
  concepts already in the brain from a prior source were silently dropped —
  exactly how the graph ended up fragmented.
- **`edges_dropped`** is now reported in the compilation result alongside
  `edges_created`, surfacing how many endpoints failed to resolve.

### Added — Tier 6 sync daemon (#26, #28, #29)

A first-class managed sync daemon replaces the manual launchd/systemd templates
that shipped with 0.2.0 (#25). Users now run `lumen sync daemon install` and
the CLI handles platform detection, plist/unit generation, lifecycle, and
adaptive scheduling.

- **`lumen sync daemon install [options]`** — generates a launchd plist
  (macOS) or systemd user service (Linux), substitutes config as
  `EnvironmentVariables` / `Environment=`, loads the unit. Detects the
  manual PR #27 plist/unit shape (`StartInterval` / `Type=oneshot`) and
  refuses to clobber it without `--replace-manual` so users who copied the
  templates aren't surprised by a silent overwrite.
- **`lumen sync daemon uninstall`** — bootouts/disables the unit and removes
  the plist/service file plus any leftover PID file. Best-effort; safe to
  run when nothing is installed.
- **`lumen sync daemon status`** — reports whether a unit is installed,
  whether it's the managed long-running shape vs. the manual short-lived
  shape, and whether the PID is alive.
- **Adaptive interval (#28)** — daemon transitions Active (default 30s
  cadence) ↔ Idle (default 300s) based on `journal_unpushed` count and a
  ring buffer of recent pull counts. Active when there's pending push work
  or recent pulls returned rows; Idle after `--idle-after` (default 3)
  consecutive empty pulls. Single-fixed-interval-with-skip implementation —
  works identically across launchd and systemd without two-unit toggling.
- **Push debounce (#29)** — bursts of journal writes (e.g. during a long
  `lumen compile`) coalesce into a single push via a `--debounce` (default
  5s) window. Pull stays on the cadence schedule and is independent of
  debounce so writes from other devices land promptly. Watermark detection
  uses `MAX(sync_id)` from `sync_journal` — O(1) on the primary-key index.
- **Decision module** is pure (`apps/cli/src/sync/daemon-decisions.ts`):
  `chooseCadence` / `chooseInterval` / `shouldPush` / `recordPull` are all
  unit-tested without standing up a journal or relay.

### Added — Tests

- `sync-daemon-install.test.ts` (16) — install/uninstall round-trip on
  macOS + Linux, manual-shape detection, `--replace-manual` flow, XML
  escaping, idempotent re-run, status reporting.
- `sync-daemon-decisions.test.ts` (13) — cadence transitions, debounce
  boundary cases, ring-buffer immutability.
- `sync-daemon-loop.test.ts` (8) — env-var config parsing, journal
  watermark behavior, PID file path under `LUMEN_DIR`.

### Changed

- `apps/cli/src/utils/paths.ts` adds `getSyncDaemonPidPath` /
  `getSyncDaemonLogPath`, scoped under the lumen data dir so the sync
  daemon's lifecycle files don't collide with the connector-watch daemon's.
- `apps/cli/src/sync/journal.ts` adds `latestJournalSyncId()` for cheap
  watermark probing on each daemon tick.

### Migration

Users who installed the manual launchd/systemd templates from PR #27 can
upgrade with:

```bash
lumen sync daemon install --replace-manual
```

The CLI detects the manual shape (`StartInterval` on launchd / `Type=oneshot`
on systemd), unloads it, and installs the long-running managed daemon in
its place.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added — End-to-end-encrypted cross-device sync (Tier 5)

Cross-device sync built as five additive sub-tiers. Local-first remains the default — the journal records every concept-touching mutation regardless of whether sync is enabled, and every payload is sealed with X25519 + XChaCha20-Poly1305 before it ever leaves the device. The relay sees only opaque ciphertext and never holds the master key.

- **Tier 5a — Sync journal foundation** (schema v15). Two new tables: `sync_state` (singleton, `CHECK id = 1`) and `sync_journal` (append-only log keyed by UUIDv7-shaped `sync_id`). Five mutator triggers (`upsertConcept`, `recordFeedback`, `updateCompiledTruth`, `retireConcept`, `captureTrajectory`) atomically append journal rows alongside their entity writes inside the same `db.transaction()` — a crash mid-write rolls both back. Per-process monotonic counter on `sync_id` guarantees within-millisecond sortability for cursor pagination.
- **Tier 5b — Encryption envelope** (`apps/cli/src/sync/crypto.ts`). Pure crypto module implementing the sealed-box scheme from `SYNC-PROTOCOL.md` §3: fresh ephemeral X25519 keypair per envelope, XChaCha20-Poly1305 with a 24-byte random nonce, recipient pubkey derived deterministically from the master key. Domain-separated derivations: `deriveUserHash` (relay routing), `deriveScopeRoutingTag` (per-scope filter via HMAC), `fingerprintMasterKey` (cross-device sanity check). Pure-TS deps (`@noble/ciphers`, `@noble/curves`); no native bindings.
- **Tier 5c — Relay HTTP client + push/pull driver + `lumen sync` CLI**. Three endpoints (POST/GET/DELETE journal, all keyed by `userHash`) with retry policy: max 5 attempts with backoff `[1s, 2s, 4s, 8s]`, `Retry-After` honored on 429, no sleep on the last attempt. `runPush` / `runPull` / `runSync` orchestrator with per-process consecutive-failure counter that opens a circuit-breaker after 5 failures (cleared via `lumen sync reset-error`). Keyring backends: macOS (`security` shell-out, key fed on stdin via `-w` no-arg form so it never appears in `ps`), Linux (`secret-tool`), file fallback (mode 0600), in-memory (tests). New CLI subcommands: `init` / `enable` / `disable` / `push` / `pull` / `run` / `status` / `reset-error` / `show-key --reveal` / `import-key <base64>` / `forget-key`.
- **Tier 5d — Reference Cloudflare Worker relay** (`apps/relay/`). Zero-knowledge journal storage backed by D1 + per-`user_hash` rate limiting via KV. Stores opaque envelopes; never holds the master key. Endpoints documented in `apps/relay/README.md`. Comes with a 25-test vitest suite via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.
- **Tier 5e — Apply rules + LWW conflict resolution** (schema v16). `applyPending(opts?)` walks `pulled_at IS NOT NULL AND applied_at IS NULL` rows and dispatches to per-op handlers (`applyConceptCreate`, `applyTrajectory`, `applyFeedback`, `applyTruthUpdate`, `applyRetire`). Each handler writes direct SQL that bypasses the journaling mutators (so applied entries don't re-journal and bounce back to the relay). Per-entry transactional boundary — if apply throws, `markApplied` rolls back so the next call retries. Last-write-wins on `truth_update` with strict `>` comparison: ties (equal `updated_at`) keep the local truth and skip the audit row; real losses (strictly older incoming) land in `concept_truth_history` with `superseded_by` set. New table: `concept_truth_history`. New CLI subcommand: `lumen sync apply` (also baked into `lumen sync run` after push → pull).

### Added — Tests

- **132 new sync tests** across the five sub-tiers:
    - `sync-journal.test.ts` (21) — schema v15, state singleton, journal CRUD, write-path triggers
    - `sync-crypto.test.ts` (23) — master key, derivations, encrypt/decrypt round-trip + tamper + version + size
    - `sync-keyring.test.ts` (14) — memory + file backend round-trip + mode 0600 + env-var selection
    - `sync-relay-client.test.ts` (15) — POST/GET/DELETE shape, retry policy, `Retry-After`, type guard
    - `sync-driver.test.ts` (22) — push/pull/sync round-trip, idempotency, scope tags, circuit-breaker, terminal-page cursor
    - `sync-apply.test.ts` (28) — per-op handlers, LWW won/lost/tie, idempotency, orchestrator
    - `sync-e2e.test.ts` (4) — full cross-device flow (A → relay → B) verifying ciphertext opacity + state convergence
    - 5 additions in pre-existing tests for write-path trigger behavior
- **25 relay tests** in `apps/relay/test/` via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`.
- Suite total: **866 passing**, 2 skipped, 11 todo (was 740 in 0.1.4).

### Changed

- `lumen sync show-key --reveal` writes the base64 master key via `process.stdout.write` (no log prefix) so it pipes/copies cleanly.
- `RelayError` is a branded type rather than a class (project-wide no-classes rule); use `isRelayError(err)` instead of `instanceof`.
- `lumen sync run` runs **push → pull → apply** in one cycle by default. Apply doesn't touch the network, so apply failures don't trip the circuit-breaker.

### Schema migrations

- **v15** — `sync_state` singleton + append-only `sync_journal` (CHECK on `op` enum, indexes on `pushed_at` / `op` / `(scope_kind, scope_key)` / `applied_at`).
- **v16** — `concept_truth_history` (last-write-wins audit; nullable `truth` since the displaced row may have been null) + partial UNIQUE INDEX on `concept_feedback(sync_id) WHERE sync_id IS NOT NULL` for apply idempotency.

Both purely additive; existing tables and prior tests untouched.

### Dependencies

- `@noble/ciphers ^1.0.0`, `@noble/curves ^1.6.0` — pure-TS, audited (Paul Miller / Noble suite), ~10 KB each, no native bindings.

### What's NOT in this release

- Multi-device key share UI — QR / BIP39 phrase / age file. Tier 6, deferred. Cross-device onboarding currently means `lumen sync show-key --reveal` on device A → `lumen sync import-key <base64>` on device B.
- Background sync scheduler. Tier 6, deferred. Push/pull is currently manual via CLI.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- Ingest expansion — three new source types and one new connector, all additive to the existing `sources`/`chunks` schema via the JSON `metadata` column:
    - **Code repositories** (`source_type: 'code'`) — `lumen add <github-url>` clones shallowly into `os.tmpdir()` and cleans up; `lumen add ./path` reads in place and captures `commit_sha` + `branch` when `.git` is present. Honours `.gitignore`, hard-skips `node_modules` / `dist` / `.next` / `target` / etc., truncates files over 50 KB, caps at 800 files per repo. Lightweight regex extracts top-level function/class/type/interface signatures for JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, Ruby, C#. `README.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `docs/` are ordered before source sections.
    - **Datasets** (`source_type: 'dataset'`) — `lumen add ./data.csv` or `lumen add https://huggingface.co/datasets/<id>`. Native CSV / TSV / JSONL parsing (quoted fields with doubled-quote escapes, delimiter auto-detection); HuggingFace datasets fetched via the `/api/datasets/` endpoint plus `/raw/main/README.md` for the card. Each dataset produces a schema table (column name, inferred type, null count in sample) and a 20-row preview rendered as markdown. Colocated `README.md` / `dataset-card.md` auto-inlined.
    - **Images** (`source_type: 'image'`) — `lumen add screenshot.png`. SHA-256 of image bytes computed into metadata; MIME inferred from extension. Optional OCR shells out to a local `tesseract` binary when it's on `PATH`; `--no-ocr` skips and stores metadata only. Missing binary produces a clear install hint (`brew install tesseract`) rather than failing the ingest. Supported: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`.
    - **Obsidian connector** (`ConnectorType: 'obsidian'`) — `lumen watch add obsidian ~/vault`. Watches a vault (or optional `subdir`), parses YAML frontmatter produced by the Obsidian Web Clipper, and promotes the `source:` URL into the `ExtractionResult` so re-clippings of the same article dedup by URL. Skips the `.obsidian` metadata folder and other dotfiles. Flat keys, inline arrays, and block-list arrays all supported.
- Auto-detection in `detectSourceType`: GitHub repo URL → `code`, HuggingFace dataset URL → `dataset`, `.csv` / `.tsv` / `.jsonl` / `.ndjson` → `dataset`, image extensions → `image`, directory containing `.git` → `code`.
- `add` command options: `--as-dataset` (force dataset handling), `--no-ocr` (skip OCR on images). `lib/add.ts` `AddInput` object form accepts an `options` field, threading `IngestOptions` through the programmatic ingest path.
- 77 new tests across `tests/code.test.ts` (20), `tests/dataset.test.ts` (20), `tests/image.test.ts` (12, one conditionally skipped when tesseract is absent), `tests/obsidian.test.ts` (19), and 7 new assertions in `tests/ingest.test.ts` for the widened `detectSourceType`. Total suite: 534 passing, 2 skipped.

### Changed

- `SourceType` union widened to `'url' | 'pdf' | 'youtube' | 'arxiv' | 'file' | 'folder' | 'code' | 'dataset' | 'image'`. No schema migration needed — the existing `source_type TEXT` column and `metadata TEXT` JSON column already accept any string / blob.
- `ConnectorType` union widened with `'obsidian'`. `watch add obsidian <vault>` becomes the recommended path for ambient browser clippings (via the Obsidian Web Clipper extension).
- `apps/cli/src/ingest/file.ts` `ingestInput` accepts an optional `IngestOptions` second argument; signature is backwards-compatible for existing callers.

### Deferred (tracked in `docs/docs-temp/INGEST-EXPANSION-PLAN.md`)

- Tree-sitter-based code parsing — current implementation uses lightweight per-language regex for signatures, which is sufficient for BM25 discovery but misses nested/complex declarations. Deferred to avoid a native-build dependency.
- Claude Vision caption pass on `compile` for images — `metadata.caption` is reserved as a placeholder; no model call yet.
- Native Parquet support — `.parquet` errors with a `duckdb` conversion hint rather than parsing. Adding `parquetjs-lite` felt like too much surface area for the current iCloud-synced dev environment.
- In-house browser extension for clippings — Obsidian path is expected to validate the flow before investing in a separate extension.
